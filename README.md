# thesis

welcome to the github page of my thesis "BERT DiD it again: Unraveling greenwashing in Danish CSR"

this repository is structured as follows:

the folder "classifications" containing all python scripts for sentence extraction, BERT-models finetuning, evaluation and classification. The classifications were performed in Google colab.

the folder "R scripts" contain five R scripts "Data cleaning", "Translation" , "Metadata cleaning", "Main data analysis", and "Descriptive overview",. 

the folder "data" contains all the .csv files used in the various scripts "ESG.csv" being the raw data file and "esg_grouped.csv" being the file used for main data analysis.

enjoy :)
